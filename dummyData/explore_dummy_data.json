       "summary":"The three laws of thermodynamics are fundamental principles in the study of thermodynamics, which is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and energy transfer. These laws provide a framework for understanding the behavior of energy in various physical systems. Here are the three laws of thermodynamics",

If heat is added to the gas, its temperature and internal energy increase, causing the gas to expand and push the piston upward, doing work. The added heat energy is converted into both the internal energy increase of the gas and the work done on the piston. This example demonstrates the conservation of energy as described by the First Law."
